Slideshow for presentation delivered to Maddie Pickens's Data Visualization course for the McCourt School of Public Policy's Data Science for Public Policy MS program. 

The presentation took place on November 14, 2023. 

This presentation provides context surrounding the Urban Institute's Upward Mobility from Poverty Project. 
It specifically helps describe the code Urban data scientists wrote to develop the factsheets. The code to develop the factsheets can be seen in Urban's public repo [here](https://github.com/UI-Research/gates-mobility-metrics-pages). 

The slides were developed in the quarto document in this repo. They can be seen [here](https://deckart2.github.io/mm-pages-presentation/#/title-slide).
