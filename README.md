This presentation provides context surrounding the Urban Institute's Upward Mobility from Poverty Project. 
It specifically provides context on the code Urban data scientists wrote to develop the factsheets. This code can be seen in Urban's public repo [here](https://github.com/UI-Research/gates-mobility-metrics-pages). 

The slides were developed in the quarto document in this repo. They can be seen [here](https://deckart2.github.io/mm-pages-presentation/#/title-slide).
